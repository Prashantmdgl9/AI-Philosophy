# AI-Philosophy

This is a rendition of the GPT-2 model that is trained on famous philosopher's works such as Plato, Aristotle, Neitzsche, Hume, Bertrand Russell etc.
I trained it for 2000 steps and then asked a few questions to it.

This model is built on Max Woolf's AITextGen, thanks to his tiny models of GPT-2, I can run these tasks on my humble machine.

It generated text which seemed fairly accurate but there was so much repetition that it felt like I am talking to a deranged person.

I ended up writing a blog on it which went viral for a day or two on reddit and medium. The answers were quite funny, you can check the blog out here <br>
