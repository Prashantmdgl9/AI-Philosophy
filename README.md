# ai-philosophy

This is a rendition of the GPT-2 model that is trained on famous philosopher's works such as Plato, Aristotle, Neitzsche, Hume, Bertrand Russell etc.
I trained it for 2000 steps and then asked a few questions to it.

It generated text which seemed fairly accurate but there was so much repetition that it felt like I am talking to a deranged person.

Please feel free to retain the model, in case you want the model email me at prashantmdgl9@gmail.com
